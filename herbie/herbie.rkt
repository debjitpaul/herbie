;;; This file is the main command-line entry point to Herbie.
;;;
;;; USAGE:
;;; - `herbie`
;;;   run Herbie, with input from and output to the console
;;; - `herbie [file ...]`
;;;   run Herbie with input from the files and output to the console
;;; - `herbie -o results.json [file ...]`
;;;   as above, but with output to a single JSON file
;;; - `herbie -o graphs/ [file ...]`
;;;   as above, but with output to a folder of reports. The `/` is required
;;;
;;; File inputs must end in `.rkt` or `/` to be valid inputs.
;;;
;;; In the future, this might evolve to have subcommands as well,
;;; which you can distinguish due to the lack of a trailing `.rkt` or
;;; `/`.
